# react
This is my first react js project in IT 111 - PLATFORM TECHNOLOGIES.
This project is created using react js, that can perform simple crud operation.

Intructions
Create or improve your React JS application so that it works properly. Your Web application must have met all the requirements:
1. It has functional components.
2. Can do route 3 or more pages.
3. Can perform 3 or more unique CRUD Operations (like CRUD for patient, medicine and doctor for clinic management system) and
4. Validation is required on all forms. For example, because one of the inputs is empty, the data from the forms cannot be entered into the database.
